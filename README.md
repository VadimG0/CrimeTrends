### **1\. Objectives**

-   **Primary Goal:** Simulate crime occurrences based on environmental, temporal, and socioeconomic factors to predict potential hotspots and trends.
-   **Learning Outcomes:**
    -   Understand how factors influence crime trends.
    -   Apply statistical or machine learning techniques to simulate data.
    -   Develop a visually appealing interface for displaying results.

### **2\. Key Features**

1.  **Synthetic Crime Data Generation:**

    -   Generate realistic crime data using probabilistic models.
    -   Base data on common influencing factors like:
        -   Time of day (e.g., higher crimes at night).
        -   Population density.
        -   Socioeconomic conditions (e.g., unemployment rates).
        -   Weather conditions (e.g., crimes during rainy days vs. sunny days).
2.  **Simulation Engine:**

    -   Create algorithms to simulate how crimes occur over time and in different locations.
    -   Introduce randomness to account for unpredictable behavior.
3.  **Trend Visualization:**

    -   Graphs for crime trends over time.
    -   Heatmaps for crime density across a simulated city.
4.  **Predictive Analytics:**

    -   Use basic machine learning (if feasible) to predict future crime trends based on simulated data.
5.  **User Interface:**

    -   Interactive dashboard to:
        -   Adjust simulation parameters.
        -   View crime occurrences on a map.
        -   Analyze crime trends over time.
